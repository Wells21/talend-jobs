# 🛠️ Talend ETL Projects by Wellspring Praise

Welcome to my repository of **professional ETL pipelines** built using **Talend Open Studio**. As a Data Integration Specialist, I have designed and implemented real-world Talend jobs that automate the extraction, transformation, and loading of data across various domains such as banking, employee analytics, and more.

This repository serves as a central hub to showcase my hands-on experience with Talend, covering end-to-end ETL job creation, folder-based logic, job orchestration, error handling, and integration with relational databases.
